				<p><i>A single paragraph of text. The text is provided by the content team and represents an excellent
						answer to the question.</i>
				</p>
				<p><u>Example:</u><br>
					When enzymes are added to a chemical reaction, it proceeds more quickly. More product is made in the
					same amount of time. Of the two lines shown on the graph, Line A shows a reaction producing more
					product in 3 seconds (Reaction A produces 200mg in 3 seconds, Reaction B only produces 20mg in 3
					seconds). Reaction A makes more product in the same amount of time, so it must be the reaction with
					an enzyme present.</p>

				<p>Long Answer Exemplar Answer</p>
				<image src="./css/images/longAnswer_example.jpg"></image>
				<p><i>A numbered list of the questions asked on the page along with an excellent answer for each on the
						next line. The answer text is provided by the content team.</i>
				</p>
				<p><u>Example:</u><br>
				<ol>
					<li>Describe Claire’s symptoms. Explain how they were related to metabolism and homeostasis.<br>
						Superbugs are bacteria that are resistant to many antibiotics. They are dangerous because
						superbug infections in people (or animals) are difficult for physicians (or veterinarians) to
						treat because commonly used antibiotics are ineffective.</li>
					<li>How did Claire’s digestions rates tell you that the problem was in her small intestine and not
						in her stomach?<br>
						We know that both Salmonella and E. coli on the farm were resistant to the FQ antibiotic. In
						order for gene flow to be responsible for the resistance in the CJ bacteria, resistance would
						have to be transferred to the CJ bacteria. Since this transfer did not occur, gene flow cannot
						be the source of the resistance in the CJ bacteria.</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p><u>Notes:</u><br>
					Do not include the section header e.g "Background".<br>
					Do not use bold.<br>
					Ordered list numbers MUST match the rubrique.

			<div id="exemplar-MultipleChoice" style="display: none;">
				<p>Multiple Choice Exemplar Answer</p>
				<p>There are a few different types that have different exemplar answers based on how many correct
					answers there are. Drag and Drop questions have a special exemplar answer.</p>
				<h5>Single correct answer</h5>
				<image src="./css/images/repeatAttempts_example.jpg"></image>
				<p><i>The answer submitted by the Case App.</i><br>
					<b>(a full empty line)</b><br>
					<i>The Right/Wrong Explanation Text seen in the Case App.</i></p>
				<p><u>Example:</u><br>
					C. Neither Salmonella nor E. Coli can transfer genes to CJ bacteria.
					<br><br>
					Because none of the CJ bacteria were green, the DNA was sent.</p>
				<h5>Multiple correct answers</h5>
				<image src="./css/images/multipleChoice_mult_example.jpg"></image>
				<p><i>A new line for each answer submitted by the Case App.</i><br>
					<i>A new line for each answer submitted by the Case App.</i><br>
					<b>(a full empty line)</b><br>
					<i>The Right/Wrong Explanation Text seen in the Case App.</i></p>
				<p><u>Example:</u><br>
					A. Another superbug was created by using the same method of giving antibiotics to chickens as Monita
					Farms. <br>
					C. The data for the control farm shows that not administering antibiotics helps to prevent superbug
					creation.
				</p>
				<h5>Drag and Drop</h5>
				<p><i>Just the phrase: "See Screenshot for reference answer.".</i></p>
				<p><u>Example:</u><br>
					See Screenshot for reference answer.

				<p>Short Answer Rubrique Format</p>
				<image src="./css/images/shortAnswer_example.jpg"></image>
				<p><i>If this is a hypothesis question that will be revised, provide an explanation and how many times
						the question can be revised along with the bullets. Otherwise, just include the bullets
						below.</i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>1 point for ...</li>
					<li>1 point for ...</li>
					<li>1 point for ...</li>
				</ul>
				<p><u>Hypothesis Example:</u><br>
					The student explains their selection for the cause of the inhibition of the photosynthesis. Students
					are able to revise their answer 3 times.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>1 point for relating the inhibition of PSII to cause a decrease in ATP concentration.</li>
					<li>1 point for stating that diuron decreases NADPH concentration by preventing electron transfer to
						PSI.</li>
					<li>1 point for stating that the inhibition of the light-dependent reactions will decrease the
						production of sugar.</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p><u>Notes:</u><br>
					Point values are provided by the content team.<br>
					All points should add up to the Points number in the Answer section above.

			<div id="rubric-LongAnswer" style="display: none;">
				<p>Long Answer Rubrique Format</p>
				<image src="./css/images/longAnswer_example.jpg"></image>
				<p><i>A numbered list of the questions asked on the page along with a bullet list of points values. The
						point descriptions and point values are provided by the content team.</i>
				</p>
				<p><u>Example:</u><br>
				<ol>
					<li>What are superbugs? Why are they so dangerous?<br>
						<ul>
							<li>1 point for recognizing that superbugs are bacteria.</li>
							<li>1 point for identifying that superbugs are resistant to the effects of many antibiotics.
							</li>
							<li>1 point for indicating that superbugs are dangerous because they are difficult to treat
								in human or animal patients.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Explain how this experiment showed that gene flow was not the cause of antibiotic
						resistance.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>1 point for ...</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p><u>Notes:</u><br>
					Do not include the section header e.g "Background".<br>
					Do not use bold.<br>
					Ordered list numbers MUST match the exemplar answer.<br>
					Always use “point” or “points”.

				<h5>Single correct answer</h5>
				<image src="./css/images/repeatAttempts_example.jpg"></image>
				<p><i># point(s) for the correct answer, only one try allowed.</i></p>

			<div id="rubric-RepeatAttempts" style="display: none;">

					<li>1 point for two tries</li>
					<li>0 points for three or more tries</li>
				</ul>

					Refer to the answer section of the rubric above. Include bullets for each point value and 0 points
					bullet that includes the try number.<br>
					No punctuation on bullets.
